## Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into a Bicycle Shop's sales performance over the past two years. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

## Data Sources
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "bike_share_yr_0.csv," "bike_share_yr_1.csv," and "cost_table.csv" files, which contain detailed information about each sale made by the company.

## Tools
- SQL Server Management Studio 20 - Data cleaning and analysis - [Download here: SQL Server Management Studio 20](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/release-history)
- Power BI - Creating reports and a visualization date - [Download here: Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)

## Recommendation 

### Conservative Increase: 
Given the significant increase last year, a more conservative increase may be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand begins to decline. An increase in the 10-15% range can test the marketâ€™s reaction without risking a significant loss of customers. 

### Pricing: 
If the price was $4.99 in 2022, a 10% increase would result in the new price being around $5.49. 
A 15% increase would result in the price being around $5.74. 

## Recommended Strategy 

### Market Analysis: 
Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction, potential changes in competition, and the overall economic environment. This can help determine whether to propose an increase at the lower or upper end of the range. 

### Segmented Pricing Strategy: 
Consider setting different prices for casual and registered users, as they may have different price sensitivities. 

### Monitor and adjust: 
Implement new prices, but be prepared to adjust based on immediate customer feedback and sales data. Careful monitoring will allow you to fine-tune your pricing strategy without becoming completely tied to a price that may be too high.
